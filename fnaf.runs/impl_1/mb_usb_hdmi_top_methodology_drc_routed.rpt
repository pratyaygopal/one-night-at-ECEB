CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net Clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): Clk_IBUF_inst/O, HexA/Clk, clk_wiz/clk_in1, mb_fnaf/clk_100MHz

DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP color_instance/addra0 input pin color_instance/addra0/C[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
