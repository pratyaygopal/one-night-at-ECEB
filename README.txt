ONE NIGHT AT ECEB - Pratyay2 and Grigel2

In order to run our code, BRAMs will first need to be made and initialized with coe files corresponding to the different sprites/images loaded in our game. To play, first set the five leftmost switches on the FPGA board to choose a seed. This seed generates pseudo-random times in which the animatronics spawn in game. The rightmost switch should also be set to enable/disable a popup on the camera. When enabled, this makes the game more difficult but adds in flashing rainbow lights that should not be used if the player is photosensitive. The project should be launched in Vivado and Vitis and ran there in order to play the game.
